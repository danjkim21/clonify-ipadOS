## About Clone-ify - iPad OS

I've always loved the visual design of the iPad operating system (OS), even through all of its development issues and delays. I wanted to recreate the enviroment and this project has evolved significantly as I explored software engineering tools and tech. <br> 

This project simulates the iPad OS, from displaying widgets, to functional applications (eg. safari, messenger, etc.). It is a work in progress and is constantly evolving as new features are planned and added.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript. <br>

This project was heavily CSS forward in terms of creating the aesthetics and design elements of the OS. I tried my best to be pixel perfect to the original design of the iPad OS. I heavily relied on flexbox (may go back and refactor with grid) in order to create the iPad Display and features. <br>

The weather widget pulls data from the OpenWeatherMaps API (currently displays weather for Washington DC, planning to update to reflect location of user). 

I found an article from blog by [Ralph J. Smit](https://ralphjsmit.com/animated-custom-cursor) that walks through creating custom mouse cursors, which I then modified to replicate the iPad OS cursor when using a mouse. 

## Lessons Learned:

I've learned that vanilla CSS is extremely powerful, but also can get quite complicated if you are not cleaning up your code often. I'll need to go back and refactor and make sense of it all. I also learned how important leaving comments are. 

## Roadmap

- [x] Fully draft README
- [ ] Refactor, refactor, refactor, & refactor
- [ ] Rebuild JS weather API and the mouse effect
- [ ] Build out each app on the dock
- [ ] Add in animations for each app open and close
- [ ] Create password screen that opens on swipe up
